description: Our Color System was created to allow for a wide variety of color combinations throughout the many different products which we create. The wide breath of colors within each color family has been created with the help of the online color tool 0 to 255 and allows for the designer to create an individual look to the app they are creating while ensuring that their colors have been thoughtfully curated. Each color family has 5 swatches which were chosen in +/- 4 increments and then passed through Web Aim’s Contrast Checker to test for accessibility and to determine which font is accessible for use.

## Selecting Your Colors


When selecting your colors from the Color System, you will always be choosing 1 Primary Color, 1 Secondary Color and 1 Accent Color. You can learn more about how to select each of these colors and how each color will be used in the descriptions below.


## Primary Color


Your Primary Color will be the most commonly used color throughout the experience. This color will be present in your backgrounds, UI and images and will define the feeling that you want to convey in your experience.

Primary Colors should be within the 200-500 numbers of your selected color family (any color except for Cloud, Success and Error) and will be designated with the “Primary” color label.

In order to ensure color accessibility with your typography, the font colors which are necessary for each color are shown in the hexadecimal name on each swatch and will be either “Light” or “Dark”.



## Secondary Color


Your Secondary Color will be present in your buttons and toggles and will be used to drive the user to the given call to action.

Secondary Colors should be within the 100-400 numbers of your selected color family (any color except for Cloud, Success and Error) and will be designated with the “Secondary” color label.

In order to ensure color accessibility with your typography, the font colors which are necessary for each color are shown in the hexadecimal name on each swatch and will be either “Light” or “Dark”.



## Accent Color


Your Accent Color will be present in your progress bars and as a visual accent where needed.

Accent Colors can be any number from 100-500 of your selected color family (any color except for Cloud, Success and Error) and will be designated with the “Accent” color label.

#### Using colors from your own branding

Our Color System was created to ensure that accessibility standards are met and colors work well with each other. We highly recommend selecting colors from the Color System when choosing your Primary, Secondary and Accent colors. Should you decide to choose other colors from either a branding handbook or other source, there is potential to run into serious accessibility issues. It’s advisable to avoid this if at all possible.
