description: Our Color System was created to allow for a wide variety of color combinations throughout the many different products which we create. The wide breath of colors within each color family has been created with the help of the online color tool 0 to 255 and allows for the designer to create an individual look to the app they are creating while ensuring that their colors have been thoughtfully curated. Each color family has 5 swatches which were chosen in +/- 4 increments and then passed through Web Aim’s Contrast Checker to test for accessibility and to determine which font is accessible for use.
