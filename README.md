# Design System Template

Design System Template is Jekyll theme and a boilerplate for creating and documenting your principles, style guides and patterns for your organization's design system. It provides just enough IA and hooks to get you going. As a bonus, I've provided links to helpful resources and inspiration to help you as you create your own custom design system. It is based on Brad Frost [Style Guide Guide](https://github.com/bradfrost/style-guide-guide/). The original code was cleaned and reworked, which leads to more straightforward maintenance of patterns and pages. Also, we speed up site generation.
